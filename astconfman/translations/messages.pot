"The time, in milliseconds, by default 160, of sound above what the DSP "

"briefly each time they begin talking until the DSP has time to establish "
"that they are in fact talking.\n"
"When talker detection AMI events are enabled, this value determines when "
"talking has begun, which causes AMI events to fire. If this value is set "

"the user has stopped talking after a period of talking. If this value is "
"set too low, AMI events indicating that the user has stopped talking may "

"stops talking. If this value is set too low, the user's audio stream may "
